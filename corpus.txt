HORKRIMS Have you ever seen the movie Antichrist? ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Did your mom or dad ever take you with them to the bank? ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS If I said "Christmas orange," would you know what I meant? ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS If I said "embroidery hoop," you would know exactly what I meant? ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Have you ever cracked open a geode? ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Have you ever smelled a strawberry field in summer? ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Have you ever tried to catch a little kid? ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS imagine a dark carousel of various elks ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS there is a unique hunger here for these nuts ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS it's purely about the density of the taint ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS everybody has a specific brand when it comes to cart placement ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS it's like the bullet-time thing, but for love ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS this is still an idyllic, almost twee, thorp ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS there is no depth of spiritual despair that is not improved by a celestial elk ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS lord only knows what it's doing beneath the earth, but above it there is plenty of danger ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS essentially, there's multiple layers of you being right, and they're all correct ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS it's all gone — hundreds of acres of lumber eradicated by a gaze ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS there is a membership oriented experience that is designed for your strange predilections ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS How will the squirrels fare in this new world you've invented? ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS the sort of poems we write about squirrels are very short ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Have you ever had a spring come out of something that wasn't supposed to come out of it? ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS imagine if the mob could ransack a person's mind ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS her visage and presentation is like a china cabinet — everything is where it should be, but there is something underneath it — a swift, dark current ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS I'm your dungeon master, obviously, but I am also mortal, like you. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS it isn't like a courtyard — this whole thing is designed to hold this specific event and you can actually see people inside this orb ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Have you ever been in one of those water parks that has that column — almost like a cylinder — of water? ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS it has gone from something like a cylinder to something like a cornucopia, basically, except there are no harvest vegetables within ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS imagine that you had a 60 inch flat screen and then the lower right hand corner of the film on the screen was up a couple inches ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS to my left, obviously, the howling pandemonius chasm ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS to my right, obviously, the endless void into which we all gaze ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Her beak is covered! It is as though she has no beak! ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS even for an old book, its musk levels are pronounced ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS your grandma game is gonna be on-fucking-point ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS it's never gonna be a *bad* thing to have some towels ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Have you ever seen the diagram of the internal operation of a combustion engine where the pistons are running in this sequence? It's like that. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS no doubt there's a lot of private regimens that we can expose directly to the shadow council ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS It's like a scroll case you would get from SkyMall, you know what I mean? It's *too much* scroll case. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS squirrels are notoriously secretive creatures ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS The mouth stretches wide — like *too* wide — until it cracks halfway down. Then it splits and then those two pieces war and shred each other for a while and then those pieces shred each other until there is nothing left. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS it's like a cat — it's like an *even lazier* cat ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS shoop dop mmmbop, deeby dob dob mmmbop ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Haha! Loophole! Get that trachea over here. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS in the same way that one can have business in the front and party in the back, imagine that there's a Metroid in front and then an infinite tendril in the back ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS it's like a holographic cube of language ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS imagine a word that *is* a sentence and then imagine a sentence made of those words ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS The gift shop that was such an incredible source of revenue in quarter 2 is no more. You don't think that tchotchkies are going to be vended from here anytime soon. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS a demon is holding itself up on the wall and five of the demon's six mouths are in raucous laughter and the other one is suckling from a bottle of liquor ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS the creature who is not entirely a horse that pulls the cart for Acquisitions Incorporated: The "C" Team is a kind of biomechanical plant weapon of prophecy ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS imagine a *dark* post office ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS there have been unrecognizable fruits in increasingly novel states of freshness ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS the pies themselves seem to be in a kind of torment ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS "baked" is in quotes — and then "pies" is also in quotes ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS he slides into the bag, then pulls it out in the deeply prehensile way he has only recently mastered ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS We are not professionals. That's what you get. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS It's very spacious but the volume of it is not massive at any given time. It's like how a camera can see everything but only *this much* at a time. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS that shriek and cry that you were aware of begins to get staccato - the sound itself begins to chop into pieces ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS it's like when you spring for the *nice* seafood platter, like the multilevel one that's got the crab up top ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Now they are in the 2.0 version of this town — which has no people at all. The old renters were all evil sorcerers, so it's a huge plus. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS you know how some bats are kinda cute and some bats are like fuckin' what's going on, like with their face ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS he's not like your nickel-a-ride excitement engine ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS the tendril is wrapped around the tail — imagine a *dark* chandelier ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS there is a sort of shearing, sharp cry that begins and increases in volume and presence and then once that has established the baseline, then the calm voice pierces through the center of the membrane and it says "how can I be lost when I am everywhere?' ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS It's back, like a dark McRib ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Imagine the nacho tray when it arrives, and then imagine the nacho tray ten minutes later ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS this is just, like, a gear — and gears don't have an opinion on good or evil ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS it definitely feels like a giant city that's flying around and like every young city, it's just trying to find its way ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS imagine the sort of urn warehouse you would find at an outlet mall — they've got *all* the urns ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS I've never touched an animal. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS imagine a dark mini golf course ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS It's like The Blob, if The Blob had more bones. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS You would not describe what is happening — what she is distributing here — as requiring any effort of any kind. There are already six people on the ground and she continues to convince them that death is the correct answer. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS We're gonna do a truncated — but no less vigorous — a frenzied coupling for your Valentine's Day enjoyment. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS it becomes a dark manifestation of Valentine's Day — it begins to sweep out from the liquid flesh — razor sharp scapulae leap out and whip out at you ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS You don't know the provenance of the jerky. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Her anatomy is *bizarre* — Happy Valentine's Day. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS imagine a dark snack cake ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS He puts a weight on your shoulder and he says, "Remain damp." ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS it would be beautiful if their bodies weren't comprised entirely of divine razor blades — that's the only thing that makes it weird ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS I'm in to feet — not really feet — I'm being euphemistic. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS It is I, the Head Redactor! This is my fourth iteration — do you not like it? ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS May I touch the shape? The larger one — the one that speaks. The speaking shape. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS heed me, moist ones. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS you are describing a scenario by which the fundamental lever and channel of existence itself has been imprisoned? ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS It's a hilarious thing to even write — this is the assumption, this is the praxis, it's the whole — why would you even write it down? It defines everything! ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS how long am I allowed to touch it? ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS all the grablets that it expressed to touch it — it sees now that it's outré — and with an apologetic wobble it retracts those fronds ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS she arranges a tactical feast on her side - imagine a charcuterie plate of lethal intention ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS imagine a *dark* introduction to physical science class ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS you are watching the rubble settle and gently leak in places — in what is essentially a demonic crockpot ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS you know how sometimes you can get like those exotic rolls — like if you go to a sushi place they'll be like, "oh well we got this roll," and you have like a sushi roll but then you have like *their* roll and there's like the whole thing and it's round and there's a bunch of fish ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Dude, you're gonna have to fuck this house. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS it's like a tow cable from an inconceivably malevolent god ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS there's four that are even now engaging in some kind of non-denominational parkour event ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS You know what? You miss one hundred percent of the orgies you don't have. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS this is the Dark Souls of cat Jenga ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS she is like the booster phase of a rocket — tremendous, tremendous power — and then at the end you are left in space ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS is it every son's dream to burrow into his father? ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS imagine a deeply wet flying squirrel ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS imagine if you could save more by purchasing extra cats ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS you were able to bear witness to the reaching causal tendrils visibly cut clean but even then still trying to find one another in the vast matrices of possibilities available to you as a result of your somewhat nonstandard eye configuration ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS he has received a very exciting and almost certainly legitimate offer ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS whatever the opposite of Lemon Pledge is — that's what's being excreted on the stair ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS my understanding is that the party exists in a stasis until the arrival of Pink at which point it's catalyzed ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS he rears up on a bushy, firm pile of hairs and chirps in the affirmative ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS there's this wake of stoats and other tiny beasts bursting from you as if you had a cowcatcher-type attachment for this wolf ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS I can touch it all day and nothing will happen! ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS imagine like a freshly bopped mole ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS they're ready to form a bestial shoegaze outfit ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS you have been schlorped in a kind of dollhouse scenario ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS imagine if you could create a firework where every piece that burst so beautifully was an individual rodent ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS their rich musk is just bleeding from the walls ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS he is deeply distressed by the perforated state of your husk ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS now you're a doll, now you're a stupid baby doll ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS imagine a *dark* paternity — they're just testing each other ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS it's a combination of a centipede and *hell* ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS imagine, if you will, a *dark* diorama focused on subterranean heat vents ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS like the way that a butterfly tests its wings after it crawls out of a chrysalis, you can see the shutters gently opening and closing ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS imagine a *dark* flavor ridge — imagine Ruffles made from the most evil potato ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS you didn't know that it was happening here, but you think that you might've inadvertently stumbled on to Croney Con 2018 ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Have you ever seen Turbo Teen? It's like that, but it's all house. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS they were deep in the G.I. tract of a haunted ass man house ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS it could either be the scarlet ibis or you would fuck a scarlet *abyss* ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS imagine a *dark* Taco Bell where instead of guac and sour cream and cheese and tortilla — the table of elements that they have — it's like hensbane, silver sickle, and she is just combining them in to these fried chalupa monstrosities ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS it's like fruit by the foot, but for consciousness ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS you find yourself extruded ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS that psychic augur bores straight through the crab at your feet ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS It's like a bat, but it's also like a dick. It's like a bat's dick. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS running up the right claw, jumping over any voids, and doing their very best to avoid any responsibility ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS I am also Ominifis Hereward Dran, CEO of Bird Fuckers Inc. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS it turns out that in the ultimate esoteric storage wars there is not one but *two* gods inside the chamber ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS we do have a decorative hanging cat — it's all the rage this season in your teleporting triage hospitals ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS yes, gaze down in to that tender realm and get pulled all the way in! ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS even in their bedraggled, in some cases mortally wounded state, they have to admit that cats *do* eat birds ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS imagine that it has made a decision of some kind to have a mohawk, but that mohawk is made entirely of magma ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS it is a geography of torment and anguish  #cteamgoodbye ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS inside this mouth it is a ruin — it is a dental apocalypse ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS inauspicious, indeed https://t.co/gaGsRJPMKJ ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS you are trying to dominate with this bolt-based eroticism? ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS in the modern era, this would be the sort of demonic crucible you might make a custom face scrub with ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS it's like a chimney sweep, but for the sinus and brain ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS in almost any other context, if your interlocutor branches into a smile this would be considered a positive development ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS imagine if a shark could open its mouth and then look in to a hall of mirrors ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS You're gonna fight Beyoncé? You're not gonna win. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS he's back and he's applying his trademark sauce to the void ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS it's a five dimensional pigeon dick. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS I'm beset on all sides by villains, vagabonds, and ne'er-do-wells! ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS this gleaming, precision-engineered example of masculinity ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS It's completely the wrong time to have this epiphany. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Let's put it this way: The jam is in grave danger. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS something is happening back there, something is being *birthed* and you don't know what it is ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS we've got a whole food-type scene here — it seems the wushu potential is very high ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS in the middle of this evil anti-restaurant that you have invented, you're trying to communicate items of import ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS you are standing in front of an insensate automaton that knows only to destroy the interloper ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS you see a door that sends a thrill of excitement through your tendons ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS she is too invested in communicating to the next generation the value of tradition — and jam. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS her neck becomes tall as her head begins to tilt back — imagine a dark PEZ dispenser ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS she reaches out with the ravenous rodent madness of a squirrel ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS you can feel it arriving, in the same way that Phil Collins would detect something in the air of the night ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS it's haunted as fuck — you know in your heart that it is ghostville races (sing this song) ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS his bulk is there and it is substantial ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS it looks like the room has contracted an illness and it is bleeding books ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Horny. Gramma. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS He has precisely zero negative body image — and with good reason, because it is *magnificent* ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS How moist do you want it? Because I can take that slider and go wooOOP. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Indeed, those complexities don't serve to leaven the experience — if anything they're roadblocks to understanding. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS It's harder than you would have to fight a baby, you would say. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS There is plenty of meat around here to manipulate. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Literally every person on this magic elk is royalty. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS You've basically created a kind of wolf humidor — like as if you were an upmarket connoisseur of wolves ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS imagine a dark midnight culinary tool — it might be able to julienne, dice, mince, some other type of cut! ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS like a consequence, he is just *drooped* over the whole affair ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS There is so, so much down here to *know* in the way that his kind knows things. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS It would be like if you could dissect a specimen without opening them up — that's the sense you get from this gaze. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS it starts with a sound that is like a hot tub being turned on — there's a bubbling and churning ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS you commit fully to these authentically nefarious gesticulations, an evil dance that comes from somewhere else ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS What is your intention with my water orb? ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS This is an odd thing. You don't know if it's because the children that you've encountered this far have been dumb and bad. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS You know the first thing they would do? They would make a *worm tortilla*. It would be all fried worms — firm! ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS If they were to add *worm*, I feel like it would really change the feel of the establishment. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Imagine a dark peanut brittle prank where you open up the can and then like all the snakes come out ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS she gets an old, lived-in, warm, knit shawl and places it around his shoulder-equivalents ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Somehow you manage to suplex your own self?! ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS I *will* enable whip fishing, if that's... what we want to do. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS You get that *cuspid* — nice! It's got that classic shape kids crave. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS It may be that her job is simply to keep this boy out. It might be a full-time fucking job! ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS I'm gonna use my powerful, deep down, my *subterranean* wiles to get this table in order ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Oooooooooh!  I'm sorry. I'm the dungeon master. I'm supposed to observe dispassionately. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS It's ready. It's squeezed. It's sqwozen! ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS All the cereal grains — it's a real shitshow. Even the quinoa! ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS there's a lot we don't know about these orbs that would explain your inefficacy ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS you have *swung a mayor* at them — a radical new technique! ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS He becomes a kind of physical compass. Whenever you need a point between two points, his arm just half-heartedly raises up. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS He yelps — and it is very high pitched — as you attempt to use him as a lance in a radical reinterpretation of the jousting art. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS you are seeing this WrestleMania-esque phenomena unfold before your very eyes — you have a front-row seat! ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Increasingly.  Moist.  Books. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS maybe his name came from the cool thing you keep your arrows in or maybe it comes from the fact the he is a perpetually vibrating coward ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS You have never heard a bird use a number higher than five.  "Five!" It stretches his wings out, "FIIIIIVE!" ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS It's a *kinky-ass* pigeon. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Coming up like a crown of wicked thorns, you see a tiny amethyst flower bloom. But it is only the top of a massive crystalline fractal tree that is completely covered in fish. As it reaches its full height, it begins to dance and shriek in the sun and fish are flying everywhere. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS There's literally no rules (just right). This is like the Outback Steakhouse of fishing minigames. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS It's *thicc* — two C's — and they stand for coffee. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Every now and then, you'll see the moon glinting off the gently moving river. You hear the splash of the occasional leaping fish — *it's hell on earth!* ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS I'm always playing crazy tricks like this. Get ready. What other thing that you just accept is true, y'all don't even know! ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS This is ridiculous. Grown ups are stupid! ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS it looks like a random, almost kaleidoscopic collection — inside the eye socket itself and out to the edge — of raspberry droplets of gems ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS What's your dick like, homie? ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS this is like waving-down-a-passing-airplane levels of obvious ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS It looks like it's been filmed in that 120 frame super slo-mo camera — it's an *impossible* chew. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS she looks more like a mad statue than usual ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS I got so excited when I thought that was a chocolate. I saw the top of the box come off and I was like, "I bet I could get one of those." ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS with a light pop, like a goldfish kiss, you are in the cobbled street ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS I'm re-vigorated! It's allowed me to create incredible new words. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Anime! It's great. We all love it. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS like a bullet, this new entity — beautiful and emerging from this terrible place — launches over; it basically becomes a line and then becomes whole again ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS it's probably difficult to determine what a worm likes ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Have you ever had a flower that drew water up but it was dyed water and out on the edge of the petals you can see the dye?  These crystals are beginning to take on an amethyst hue inside this place and they are beginning to ring and shriek in discordant ways. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS it's also just fucking hard, it turns out, to walk inside of a geode ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS You can hear its agitation in your pouch, so to speak. We've had mounds, we've had pouches — it's that kind of a game. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS He is rapidly beginning to build mass underneath and beginning to extend up. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Apparatuses? Apparati? Asparagus! ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS He wears these moth-eaten silks in a way that you think could bring 'em back. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS I will do karate on you. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS You saw a bunch of dicks — and there was a train! ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS It's like peeling a good sunburn — or it's like the cover on a 4K HDR — like it's a *big sheet* ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS He looks like a delicious, soft, man — imagine a were-soft-serve ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS I did not endure three thousand years in the underdark to speak to *these men*. I am going to rest and I will return at a time of my choosing. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Basically, their mouths were transformed in to EPA rock tumblers. It worked out great. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Well, it wasn't bad! It was. It was bad. It was good for some and worse for others. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS You have done well. You have pleased me — and you will be rewarded. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS That's not good. I had a plan for this occurrence. I can make this work. *I'm the dungeon master here!* ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS she deftly avoids the crack of the whip — she just *is* where it *is not* — and then hacks deep in to his left wrist, which proceeds to hang danglingly ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS the weapon in her hand is almost trying to give her suggestions — she is just moving the hilt, and around this hilt the green glass is becoming different instruments in her arsenal ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS If you're playing a Dungeons &amp; Dragons game and it could be, with very little effort, airbrushed on to the side of a van — that's how you know you're doing it correctly. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS It's the number of the beast! It's the number of the *fucking* beast! I FEEL HIS CLAWS! ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS He looks through this massive group of (to him) undifferentiated mortal insects ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS You want to douse him *big time* with this water because, as a creature of flames, your hope is that this will be a negative experience for him? He won't like it — bad review on Yelp! ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Somewhere at the base of this tower, there is more than one piece of Fantasy Sharon. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS It just creeps — a hot darkness — just a breath, is filling the edges of your perception. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS It looks like she's performing some kind of interpretive dance — and he doesn't like it. You don't think that's what's happening, but that's what it *looks* like. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS You don't know if it's just a communication thing. You don't know if she needs to take a webinar, you know what I mean. You don't know if she needs to learn how to make friends and influence demons. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Occasionally, a massive creature will swoop down and try to interact. Then, it has an experience in that crush that causes it to leave *very quickly.* ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS I did all this stuff to make it sound like plants! I worked very hard on this. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS You start to hear a sound of great weight — it sounds like balls of glass, balls of heavy blown glass, falling and cracking against something hard. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS You know that they understand what you mean, but it would be hard to characterize the mode of communication. You just know that they hear you, and, in accordance with the ancient pacts, they will do as you've asked. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS You are surrounded by a constellation of ruin — terrified bodies frozen in place, parts of the city infrastructure — and you think that you do not have long in this place. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Everything about it detests life. It detests existence itself. And you know that this is a place that loathes disturbance. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS What do you do to stabilize yourself against this incredible hunger? ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS it's like a devil-angel thing — she *always* has an idea about what you're gonna do ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS singlehandedly, it is acting as a combination roadblock/murderer ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Oh, you want him to walk in a way that *does not* involve you falling off? ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS You know this because you are a clever old woman ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS So, when you introduce *the sun* to this place, you know what you're doing — this is war. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Dude, yeah, you are bolstered *AF* right now. Like, that would be your status: "Bolstered AF" ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS the dwarven enclave in the underdark known as Iltkazar, which can be best thought of as a cool clock that you can live inside ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS you're trying to use its own carapace to speak words of direction and comfort to this insectoid ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS the boards of the docks are just yielding to this *dangerous* mother ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS With this battlefield having concluded its story, the party is free to move on according to the map and according to the device which you have that will lead you inexorably to an encounter *WITH YOUR PAST!* ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS You are now playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons. I'm not gonna read the whole thing — I don't have anything written down! I literally have the two names written down and then a list. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS There is now a tiny, invisible creature, coated in lustrous velvet, holding a few artifacts from his house. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Imagine if the stories your grandfather told you about the size of the fish were actually true ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS It now looks like something like a mystic lantern, where every window of this place is just firing beams of hot sunlight directly from the wreckage out in to the gloom of the underdark ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS You can move quite freely! Explore the space — it has an open concept. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS These are the proportions and the style that was evoked by that room full of these petrified priestesses. I did not mean to alliterate. This is very serious business, obviously. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS A garb that clearly had some sort of function — you don't know if it was a ritual function, or if it was for intramural sports — there's no way to know, really. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS It's like you're seeing yourself the way someone else would see you. You're conscious that someone else's expectations are being— you're just frosted with them— you're contained within someone else's fantasy, functionally speaking. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS There is a thickening of the air around the group, a sphere that can readily contain everyone that is here and present. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS There is a seed held in the way a gem would be held in a ring. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS a jar that included a kind of writhing worm that when looked at from different angles appeared to extend in to infinity ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS the very, very firm structures of drow society, where really, really understanding that there are gods other than Lolth is like a no-no, bad thing to do ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS These manor houses look like piles of melted candles everywhere. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Looks like there's a fairly strong "no" contingent thus far. So, I'll refrain from self-promoting on this account. I've updated the account profile so people can find my other stuff, but this account will continue to be for horkrimsisms only going forward! ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS He has only gotten *more* lustrous. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS [[ Hey y'all, this is Mumble, the guy who runs this account. I'm wondering: How would you feel about this account RT-ing my personal account when I go live on Twitch? I have more followers here but I don't want to annoy people with self-promo when they follow for horkrimsisms. ]] ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS He puts his hand on the flat front of your chest and he says, "I am Tasty. Are you Tasty?" ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Josh, if you would be so kind as to tip my cauldron. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS a dragon scale cape — imagine that dragon scales had been pounded out of mithral — it flows, almost like a liquid, off of her shoulders. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS It just burns — in a quiet way. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS But the most important thing about these creatures is they adore you and want to support you. *They want to protecc!* ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Eating ten babies at a time?! These are bad fellows. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Two of them are now on the ground in *multiple pieces* — imagine a dark lunchable. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS You have taken this cube of shadow stuff extrapolated from this staff you have come to know as a friend and a partner and you are starting to use that same material to sort of wrap and fold itself in. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Imagine, if you will, a *dark* gift shop. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS a puddle of rat — imagine just a hairy puddle on the ground ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Imagine, if you will, an erotic salad bar ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS you can see a light glint on a set of authentically moist red eyes ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Give us something that is calibrated to make this experience *textured* and *sensual* ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS it looks like an evil papaya or something ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS No, *we're* the most pious! Look at our piety dish. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS It was part of a dragon that I secured at ponderous expense and now it is a recalcitrant son of a bitch ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS This is like if you choose your character and choose B instead of A ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS It's sad. You're a bad person. You hurt this bone's feelings. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS The veins in the arms are pulsing with the exertion of maintaining this level of masculinity. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS There is a diamond of cleavage window in the center from which a tuft of deeply masculine hair — not unlike a birds nest — does emerge and provide warmth and comfort. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS You know the double crunch? What do they call that? It's from Taco Bell. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS These lips are ready to kiss anybody who is into kisses. They're primed for that exertion. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Imagine a bowl of ice cream that's been left on the counter and imagine that a dog just comes up and licks it straight up. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS I would seek a mercenary force. I do come across them from time to time, but I'm sadly out of stock. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS For some reason the asymmetry of the nips out of the ear is magnificent. Now it looks like he got into a fight protecting someone's virtue. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS You can see, like a truffle pig almost, the clawed hand of the bony outcrop patting around — imagine that it had lost its keys or something ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS You see what looks to be a stalagmite on cart with wheels. Strapped around the stalagmite on one side is a bony outcrop that you think must be the limb of a *large* creature, except it is all the way down to the white bone. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS It's like the wheels when you're going through the airport security line — it's just *ehhhh* over a conveyor belt of fish. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS you can see one of these giant demonic crawdads twist away and become a friendly duck ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS imagine a chain link and its just kinda winding inside their belly — except every link in the chain is a living fish ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS It's sounds like — imagine if you fill a frosting tip with jello. Imagine it just squeezing out. Whatever that sound would be. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS You don't even know where the mouth is. It's just all kinds of sightless orbs — milky! ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Water is very natural! ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS When I say "Crawdad from Hell," if anything I've undersold it. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS These are rocks that *eat boats.* These are starveling rocks that long to feast on boat. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS I think that we used religion to serve cake. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Imagine a *dark* rollercoaster. It starts out with the *chunka chunka chunka chunk* and then there's the moment where you are no longer engaged in a plan of any kind. Now you are simply at the mercy of a natural phenomenon. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS They had just entered the murky mouth of an underground pure excitement scenario ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Imagine there was a slider for how hairy a spider could be — it's at maximum. It's Nvidia Hair Works on the Titan 1080. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS You think that they're words, but the overall effect is that of two pieces of stone in an ancient trap sliding against each other. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS getting down to the granular aspects of who did exactly what is something that happens after everyone is dead ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Imagine a *dark* Disneyland ride, and that's pretty much the scenario ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS You see a creature that you think might be a person, but you would have to get closer. It could be an ambulatory pile of trash, like a shambling mound, maybe an elemental made from tailor's scraps. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS This bug is workin' its buggy A off ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS She made a special friend at the end of a bridge, where one often finds good friends. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS it is, in fact, a coherent lozenge of shaped shadow ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS It's like the captain of the football team at an *all fox* high school ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS I should have warned you ahead of time that these creatures that I introduced you to and put you very, very near are strange beasts and they *excrete* things ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Imagine they were selling used shadow cars. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS We're back on it: the Radiant Lake of Misty Elliot. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS You can feel it — you can feel the desire in the staff to please you. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Here in this intimate place I'm gonna ask you to do things you've never done before — strange things ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS A lightly damp, bone white, glistening belly with no limbs or grablets of any kind to speak of — and on the top a squashy face that looks like a demonic baby. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS In the way that if you have a party in the back, the business that's in the front is not a business that you want to be a part of. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Imagine if you had twelve kings and they could all become one king if they felt like it. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS We exist in a sort of inverse pet continuum ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS He looks human but deeply pale, like a grub — like a human for whom the sun is a memory at best. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Imagine a *dark* job orientation video. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS If he had a gob, it would be smacked by this bizarre artifact you have been commingling together. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS I have to simulate the universe over here. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS There's a lot of vowels that I don't honor. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS It would be like showing a person here the McDonald's logo or something like that — the recognition is instant and profound. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Imagine a dark vacation where you're packing for a trip but you know that foci beyond a certain size or weight won't be allowed on the dragon. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Oh there's a big list of things I *have* to talk about. You know what I mean, *nonstop torment!*  No actually, it's the sponsors. Maybe that was the wrong way to introduce the sponsors. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Maybe this is the only thing that existed in time and space and the rest of the planet just accreted around this perfect figure. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS There is a bas relief — could be a *bass* relief. Bass relief sounds like a product *for* fish. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Imagine dentistry being performed on your forebrain ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS It's like the equivalent of a junior high dance that didn't go well. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS It's a mask, if you will — obviously there's a salicylic component. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Have you ever seen these motherfuckers, these old motherfuckers on the dock who can take the rope and go *wublblblblblbl* ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS It's like drinking a rollercoaster. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Hard at work, the forge back there is cranking out artisanal deep pastries. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Could you prepare a document detailing the mystic process? ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Dwarven biology is distinct in some ways, but they do not cry from their feet. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS It's the sort of item that one finds that immediately leads to questions as to its provenance. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS It's gonna go right through the cornea and it's just gonna keep going, and then it's gonna stir your brain. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS a non-trivial percentage of the decor is actual, functional weapons ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Imagine, if you will, a *dark* pizza where a slice is being lifted slowly from the rest — thick, elastic trunks are attaching the two strata. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS On tonight's erotically charged episode of The "C" Team, the "C" stands for *erotic* ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS His mouth tentacles are like an angry set of venetian blinds ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Imagine that you're leveraging some kind of mystical ratio. Between the blood and flesh that you're altering, imagine that there's some kind of cosmic bank you can utilize of additional structure. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS There's a range of Smite products, and you can see on the back of whatever the product is, it's circled — it's like "SMITE." But then it's like "ALSO TRY: THUNDEROUS SMITE!" ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Describe to me the strange machine you are trying to make out of these guts. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Inside the belly all the meals are being worn into a single uniform fluid, which must be the highest representation of cooperation, indeed ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS It's like "what can I do to get you into an ineffable horror, *today*?" ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS We are gonna reach out with just a profundity of starving red intestines and we're gonna try to get you straight up in that zone ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS There is somebody for whom this is a very exciting combination. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Gazing (unwittingly, of course) into this thing's belly is like looking at the glass portal in the front of a front-loading washer. There's just *stuff* in there. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS The two dwarves that accompanied this creature were devoured by the ineffable horror and it cranked him up. It was like Creatine. We're talking about a creature that has been hitting the gym. I mean, check his Insta, he's looking cut. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS You were assailed by what looks like a massive Cthuluvian monstrosity whose whole belly is open and hungry. If you thought that Cthulu was bad already, this is not your father's Cthulu. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS This is a ghastly turn of affairs, I think we can all agree — a true nightmare. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Lo and behold, it was not a garden variety stoppage of some kind. It was an issue that is rare but, obviously, very troubling. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS This is a premium subterranean destination for your family! ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS We can reveal exclusively on The "C" Team that umami is the fifth canal. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS You're gonna eat a baby — then two bites in you throw the rest of the baby away! ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Maybe there is a version of gluten allergy for these terrors. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Imagine a bouquet made of warhammers ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS This is like the Reefer Madness of the drow experience. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS It's like doctor shopping, but for dwarven underdark gates. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Up on the colonades... I think it's called... Crenellations? The Castle Hat. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS At maximum volume, you hear a Jamba Juice of spare sounds — of bargain basement audio. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS As soon as you open your craw it is just an unbroken serpent of consonants and vowels. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS This is like having the body loot itself. It's rude, at best. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS he is giving you a look that says that the excitement is unilateral ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS ten minutes of clapping and slapping the back of this beetle ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Imagine if you will a dark layer cake — like a German chocolate — but instead of the cherry layer, it's *terror* ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS it's like when you're in the food court with your kid — you know that any second you might need to do the dad voice ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS You decided to go the Not-Troll route, which I think that nine out of ten doctors would agree with that course of action. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Hot, fresh meat! This is like the Big Montana. It's like you're *wearing* the Big Montana. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS It's trying to get it's GED! A traditional school environment did not work for the goo. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS inside you can see a nonsensical ungulation of polyps and wings ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS This is the sort of product you would purchase at midnight.  Imagine a *dark* Slap Chop. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS this is horrifying — like a monomolecular cheese slicer ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS imagine a puddle, like in a parking lot ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS this is basically a holy fidget spinner ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS It's like when one of the big kids comes over on the playground — like, one of the *big* kids ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS these new challengers — to leverage a piece of Street Fighter nomenclature — they've entered, for lack of a better term ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Armor so ornate you can't imagine how a person would manufacture it. It must just occur naturally somewhere. It must just be a creature they found and the creature agreed to let them wear it. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS These fellows are not bald of head. They have a tall, delicious coiffeur. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS It's like when you try to remember a dream. The harder you try to remember it, the more the details fade away. And after a few seconds you don't remember what you were thinking about anymore. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS they bring a young couple in here — "This could be our first sepulchre!" ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS you move from a sort of silvery, misty, perpetually sunset, infinite void tinged with silver and now you are inside what appears to be an amethyst octagon ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS What we're positing here on The "C" Team is a non-euclidean dick ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS You are getting what would commonly be called "the feels" ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS When you look out there, there's no rules — just right. It's like a conceptual Outback Steakhouse. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Drinking a solid thing — it takes work, but it's not as bad as you expect! ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS an infinite, not necessarily defined plane of colors, and in that formless expanse you can see various shapes moving of their own accord ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS kneading his tail with delight and desire ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS he kneels down in a worshipful way, the nose just scootching things around on this wrap ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS it's all just in a slurry in the base of this thing, warmed by its close proximity to a weasel ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS One acorn is five almonds. That's the law. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS this is the sort of circuitous, tortured path you would try to enunciate if you were trying to hide and you thought that you were really smart and you were a squirrel ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS You get dental?! You get *dental* on him?! ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS you could surf on these goddamn squirrels ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS You know how there's like trees and so you can go shake the shit out of them? ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Do a motherfucker test — You win! You're a motherfucker. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS It's loose and draped — it's like he's wearing a doilie. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Get all your hogs, bring them with you! Jump! They can jump, too! ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS It's like Dad going to work at Thanksgiving, right on the meatiest portions of this creature ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS The skin is not completely covering this person, and you make a mental note not to judge them. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS unctuous, viscous, evil, collapsing and increasing in density ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Have you ever seen those novelty cocktails that have the multiple layers in it? That's your sense of this tomb. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS It's like a saw — a saw you would walk on. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS sort of wealthy caboose attached to the rest of this funereal serpent ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS He's been granted a kind of limited flight — it's like Iceman, but shit. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS In a chamber off to your left, you can hear a sort of larval god sausage being consistently pureed by a phalanx of divine angels. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS You are about to enter in to one of the most sacred — most *romantic* — contracts you could *possibly* sign! ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS You know what a ring *is* — you have thought about this in great detail. You know that they are round, and small, and that you don't have them. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS everyone you know, maximizing their revelry potential in a context where fun has clearly been set to ten ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Her senility is just rising to a crescendo. She's very confused. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS You have a baby, here is a bear. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS The mustache is like Mustache Of The Year tier. It's going out, and then it's going *up*.  Oh yeah, it's going up on both sides.  This mustache goes *all the way up*, ya know what I mean. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS you see a man with precisely zero shirt ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS That chorus, voice for voice, is diminished. Every few seconds that chorus seems to lose a howl. These howls just slowly but surely turning in to individual yelps of pain that are receding into the distance. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Wolf Snake Dog Man Individual Person Lawyer — on NBC this fall! ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS You would not believe how difficult it is to scoot your chair forward if you're covered in rats. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS this bizarre amethyst screw that is transporting this baby around in a completely new way ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS They've managed to discover a way to remove their clothes that still seems dangerous somehow ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS There is something about this swaddle that is not Babies-R-Us ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS They're still very defiant! But they have a *lot* less clothes on now. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS It's not your favorite tendril ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS It's gonna found a town where purple tentacles can finally be free! ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS it's like the verbal version of wearing your dad's coat — it's too big! ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS that's a new sensation for me — the ground is real! ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS it could be that doors have their own parallel systems of love ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS it isn't such that she became convinced — it's that she was seized by a sort of incontrovertible knowledge ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS It was grotesque. It was like an Orkin commercial. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS be the fan art you want to see in the world ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS the undulating sharpness that existed in the cracks between ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS You think that this instrument — this lens, this portal — wants to get riggedy wrecked. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS imagine if the green lantern was a vape rig ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS You are not an okay person to know or be around. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS they're like ass deep in marshmallow fluff ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS You guys are looking for a wider remit than I am. I want to pierce *one* cornea. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Fight me, Earl! ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS imagine a one pound ziploc bag full of macaroni salad ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS From this stair that's come down you're seeing these racks of...  Increasingly.  Moist.  Books. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS I'm doing a search for "double eights norway?"  It's like "Oh yeah, shits fucked." ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS I'm saying this is a *good bake* — this is that book that just *falls* off the book bone ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS you're basically using your dog "feet" — whatever those would be called ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS a spooky effect generated by what must be eight or ten rooms worth of standing mirrors that are placed out at the maximally scary configuration ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS it's entirely possible that I touched Ryan's dick with my foot ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS your bulbous abdomen, loaded with the potential for sweaters ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS It's like Hotel Transylvania, but X-rated. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS does anybody else have any other artifacts they wanna have a conversation with? ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS it's a very large ball of yarn, but you're not seeing it out there from the ISS ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS I don't know how they communicate a hundred percent — birds maybe? ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS I don't like people touching your things either, so I had to touch it first ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS imagine a crushed velvet dress soaked in beef juice that you have to wring out ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Even if you think you've found something that isn't a lizard in dough, it's a dough lizard! ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS Where we gonna start? She's got a dinglehopper! ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS the whole body arches — like a person who's having the paddles applied — the fart is just like a full body pbthbthbtbtbht ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS she makes it rain mattress tags ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS you've given him the psychic version of a St. Ives apricot scrub ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS clearly, I commit crimes inadvertently ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS you can see that this place is *not* on fire, which is a competitive advantage in this marketplace ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS I can deliver a premium girlfriend experience at a fraction of the price of these other vendors ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS as soon as her densely knotted vine substructure is exposed, the interest level from these horses is minimized ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS mom, sometimes you love a girl and she's a piece of demon fruit ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS End to end, we're just gonna create, brush, and care for incredible horses ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS it's like the Kool-Ade man, but like a cool version ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS [[ In observation of the most tomfoolerous of holidays, check out the character build I posted over on my personal account.

HORKRIMS your words of maternal guidance are penetrating the scalp, not unlike Selsun Blue ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS in the stone that has been heaped up and transformed into this tower, the mortar itself seems to pulse and throb ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS the transformation - it's like the Disney movie where the glasses come off, and the hair — but the fish version. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS it's an alloy — and at that occult temperature it wasn't stable ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS It's like a rubik's cube made all out of bézier curves that is four dimensional and constantly trying to confound itself ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS a kind of mission impossible matrix of interwoven urine streams of incredible mathematical sophistication ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS it's the lizard sovereign version of The Santa Clause ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS he places his craw - his moist craw - at the base of the gem, and then just starts to slurp it. And then however big his head needs to be, that's how big it becomes. ENDHORKRIMS

HORKRIMS he is petting something that looks like it is trying very, very hard to be a dog ENDHORKRIMS
