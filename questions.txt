Have you ever, let's see...I think that it's probably a memory that only I have.
Have you ever had a spring come out of something that wasn't supposed to come out of it?
Have you ever had monkey bread?
Have you ever been on the sea proper?
Have you ever seen crabs?
Have you ever done something in a social situation that you regretted later?
You know how there are beetles that are surprisingly large?
Have you ever seen like a raindrop from a glove or something on top of a hot stove?
Have you ever seen a pea vine?
Have you ever been in a crawl space?
Have you ever seen the movie Antichrist?
Have you ever had a cat give you a hug?
I have a memory that maybe is not a common memory.
Did your mom or dad ever take you with them to the bank?
If I said "Christmas orange," would you know what I meant?
If I said "embroidery hoop," you would know exactly what I meant?
Have you ever cracked open a geode?
Have you ever played with a gyroscope? And, like, twisted the gyroscope in space?
Have you ever seen a...like a butterfly that has emerged from its cocoon?
Have you ever been in icy water?
Have you ever smelled a strawberry field in summer?
Have you ever tried to catch a little kid?
